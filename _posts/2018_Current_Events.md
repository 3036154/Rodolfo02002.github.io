What happened: A gunman opened fire at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, late Wednesday night.
Eyewitnesses say the man fired at people in a packed bar during college night.
Shooter Ian David Long’s mother “lived in fear” of what her son might do, 
saying when police were called to the house earlier this year “it took them about a half a day to get him out of the house," a
neighbor told CNN.

Neighbor Richard Berge said Long’s mother told him she was concerned about her son, though not worried about her own safety,
and that “she was… kind of beside herself, she didn’t know what to do because he wouldn’t get help.” 
Berge continued: “When I saw the house this morning, I knew what it was,” referring to the police activity.
